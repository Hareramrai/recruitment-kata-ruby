# Explanation for changes

### I am going to add the reason/insights for each of valuable changes pushed to the repo for solving this code assignment.

1.  Add specs to improve confidence for future changes.
    - As our existing solution is a complex one to understand and to do any modifications. So it's better to have spec coverage for the current implementation.
    - Also, having the specs for existing implementation will be helpful in refactoring and in finding any unknown issue introduce while adding any new feature.
2.  Abstract update item logic to a private method & create constant for magic strings.
