# Explanation for changes

- I am going to add the reason/insight for each of valuable changes
pushed to the repo for solving this code assignment.

* Add specs to improve confidence for future changes
 - As our existing solution is a complex one to understand and do any modifications.
  so it's better to have spec coverage for the current implementation.
 - Also, having the specs for existing implementation will be in refactoring and in finding any unknown issue introduce while adding any new feature.
